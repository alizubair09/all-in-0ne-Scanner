# Changelog
### Developed on BackBox (INTEDED USE FOR KALI BASED OS)

## 18/03/2023
- I would just to suggest to exec the script from the directory clone folder `phisherprice` for full functionality unless you want banners then install
- even then i would just type `sudo pp -b`(with banners) or `sudo pp`(without banners) in the cloned repo directory for full functionality
- if you dont mind not having the beta features then `sudo pp` in any cli
